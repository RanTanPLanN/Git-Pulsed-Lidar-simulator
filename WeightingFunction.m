function WeightFunc = WeightingFunction(probeLengthVec, FunctionShape)
%
% PURPOSE: Create the range weighting function for a pulsed LIDAR. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inputs:
%
% 1. probeLengthVec : Vector. The discretized length of the probe into
% probe.Points (see main script).
% 2. FunctionShape: Char. Defines the shape of the weighting function. If 
% FunctionShape = 't' then the function is triangular, else if 
% FunctionShape = 'g' it is Gaussian.
%
% Outputs:
%
% 1. WeightFunc: A vector with the discretized range weighting function. This will be
% applied on the probe points to obtain a single measurement.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% FUTURE WORK: Develop a generic range weighting function both for pulsed
% and CW lidar.
